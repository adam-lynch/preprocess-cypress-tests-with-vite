# preprocess-cypress-tests-with-vite

An example project for my [How to preprocess Cypress tests with Vite](https://adamlynch.com/preprocess-cypress-tests-with-vite) article.

How to run the tests:

1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm test` to open the interactive test runner (which also watches for changes), or run `npm run test--watch` for headless mode.
